In this repository I will put my exercises from "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python"

## Problem Set 0
 - **Indoor Voice**
    - WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
      Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
      In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
 - **Playback Speed**
    - Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.
      In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
 - **Making Faces**
    - Before there were emoji, there were emoticons, whereby text like :) was a happy face and text like :( was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!
      In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.
    Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.
 - **Einstein**
    - Even if you haven’t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that E - mc², where E in represents energy (measured in Joules), m represents mass (measured in kilograms), and c represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.
    In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.
 - **Tip Calculator**
    - In the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Not to worry, though, we’ve written a tip calculator for you, below!

## Problem Set 1
 - **Deep Thought**
    - n deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.
 - **Home Federal Savings Bank**
    - In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.
In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
 - **File Extensions**
    - Even though Windows and macOS sometimes hide them, most files have file extensions, a suffix that starts with a period (.) at the end of their name. For instance, file names for GIFs end with .gif, and file names for JPEGs end with .jpg or .jpeg. When you double-click on a file to open it, your computer uses its file extension to determine which program to launch.
Web browsers, by contrast, rely on media types, formerly known as MIME types, to determine how to display files that live on the web. When you download a file from a web server, that server sends an HTTP header, along with the file itself, indicating the file’s media type. For instance, the media type for a GIF is image/gif, and the media type for a JPEG is image/jpeg. To determine the media type for a file, a web server typically looks at the file’s extension, mapping one to the other.
See developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types for common types.
In a file called extensions.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:
    .gif
    .jpg
    .jpeg
    .png
    .pdf
    .txt
    .zip
   If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.
 - **Math Interpreter**
    - Python already supports math, whereby you can write code to add, subtract, multiply, or divide values and even variables. But let’s write a program that enables users to do math, even without knowing Python.
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
    x is an integer
    y is +, -, *, or /
    z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.
Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
 - **Meal Time**
    - Suppose that you’re in a country where it’s customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had a program that could tell you what to eat when?
In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.
Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

## Problem Set 2
 - **camelCase**
    - In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called `name`, a variable for a user’s first name might be called `firstName`, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called `preferredFirstName`.
      Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (`_`), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called `name`, `first_name`, and `preferred_first_name`, respectively, in Python.
      In a file called `camel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.
 - **Coke Machine**
    - Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca‑Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents. In a file called `coke.py`, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.
 - **Just setting up my twttr**
    - When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
 - **Vanity Plates**
    - In Massachusetts, home to Harvard University, it’s possible to request a vanity license plate for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. Among the requirements, though, are:
      “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”  
      “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”  
      “Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, `AAA222` would be an acceptable vanity plate; `AAA22A` would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”  
      “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”  
      In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then outputs `Valid` if it meets all of the requirements or `Invalid` if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein `is_valid` returns `True` if `s` meets all requirements and `False` if it does not. You’re welcome to implement additional helper functions for `is_valid` to call (e.g., one function per requirement).
 - **Nutrition Facts**
    - The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) offers downloadable/printable posters that “show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits … in the United States. Retail stores are welcome to download the posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close proximity to the relevant foods in the stores.” In a file called `nutrition.py`, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the FDA’s poster for fruits, which is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., `strawberries`, not `strawberry`). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
