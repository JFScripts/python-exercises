In this repository I will put my exercises from "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python"

## Problem Set 0
 - **Indoor Voice**
    - WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
      Best to use your ‚Äúindoor voice‚Äù sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
      In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
 - **Playback Speed**
    - Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it‚Äôd be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube‚Äôs 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.
      In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
 - **Making Faces**
    - Before there were emoji, there were emoticons, whereby text like :) was a happy face and text like :( was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!
      In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.
    Then, in that same file, implement a function called main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on that input, and prints the result. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call main at the bottom of your file.
 - **Einstein**
    - Even if you haven‚Äôt studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that E - mc¬≤, where E in represents energy (measured in Joules), m represents mass (measured in kilograms), and c represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.
    In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.
 - **Tip Calculator**
    - In the United States, it‚Äôs customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal‚Äôs cost. Not to worry, though, we‚Äôve written a tip calculator for you, below!

## Problem Set 1
 - **Deep Thought**
    - n deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.
 - **Home Federal Savings Bank**
    - In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn‚Äôt greeted with a ‚Äúhello.‚Äù Kramer is instead greeted with a ‚Äúhey,‚Äù which he insists isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhello,‚Äù and so he asks for $100. The bank‚Äôs manager proposes a compromise: ‚ÄúYou got a greeting that starts with an ‚Äòh,‚Äô how does $20 sound?‚Äù Kramer accepts.
In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with ‚Äúhello‚Äù, output $0. If the greeting starts with an ‚Äúh‚Äù (but not ‚Äúhello‚Äù), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user‚Äôs greeting, and treat the user‚Äôs greeting case-insensitively.
 - **File Extensions**
    - Even though Windows and macOS sometimes hide them, most files have file extensions, a suffix that starts with a period (.) at the end of their name. For instance, file names for GIFs end with .gif, and file names for JPEGs end with .jpg or .jpeg. When you double-click on a file to open it, your computer uses its file extension to determine which program to launch.
Web browsers, by contrast, rely on media types, formerly known as MIME types, to determine how to display files that live on the web. When you download a file from a web server, that server sends an HTTP header, along with the file itself, indicating the file‚Äôs media type. For instance, the media type for a GIF is image/gif, and the media type for a JPEG is image/jpeg. To determine the media type for a file, a web server typically looks at the file‚Äôs extension, mapping one to the other.
See developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types for common types.
In a file called extensions.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file‚Äôs media type if the file‚Äôs name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:
    .gif
    .jpg
    .jpeg
    .png
    .pdf
    .txt
    .zip
   If the file‚Äôs name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.
 - **Math Interpreter**
    - Python already supports math, whereby you can write code to add, subtract, multiply, or divide values and even variables. But let‚Äôs write a program that enables users to do math, even without knowing Python.
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user‚Äôs input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
    x is an integer
    y is +, -, *, or /
    z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.
Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
 - **Meal Time**
    - Suppose that you‚Äôre in a country where it‚Äôs customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you had a program that could tell you what to eat when?
In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it‚Äôs not time for a meal, don‚Äôt output anything at all. Assume that the user‚Äôs input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal‚Äôs time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it‚Äôs 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it‚Äôs time for breakfast.
Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).
